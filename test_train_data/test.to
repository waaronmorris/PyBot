Considering it's mostly white women passive aggressively posting pictures of mostly minority men who they are too scared to actually ask to move ... I'd say there is a bunch of racism involved too. 
Delete this post, its gonna make scalpers make it harder for everyone.
I don't think so either, but the Coyotes GM threatened that no one was safe. Might have just been a scare tactic.

Jon's frame is clearly bigger but I doubt he's much heavier. I don't think he's far more muscular in the torso and Rockhold's got bigger legs.
Yeah, I definitely got lucky with that. I did need to explain it to her, though. Maybe give that a try.
