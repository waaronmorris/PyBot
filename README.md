# Chatbot  
This repo contains two chatbots. One is trained on a dataset from Reddit while the other is trained on a dataset of movie quotes. <br/>

# Natural Language Processing (NLP)
Natural Language Processing is a category of Machine/Deep Learning which is not merely limited in application to the engineering of chatbots. Some other examples are as follows: <br/>
1. If/Else Rules (Chatbot): This is one of the first ways chatbots were created (i.e. Q & A). This primitive, mechanical approach does not approach anything "realistic" (humanlike). <br/>
2. Audio Frequency Component Analysis (Speech Recognition): These are algorithms written without implementing Deep Learning models. This involves the analysis of human speech through sound waves compared to a pre-recorded human speech. There is no neural computation. Instead, there are mathematical calculations of the frequencies in order to match up words or sentences. <br/>
3. Bag of Words Model (Classification): A very popular approach to text analysis. There are, however, some drawbacks. For instance, it has a fixed-size input. It also doesn't take word order into account since it only counts each occurence of each word. In that sense, the order in which the words appear is irrelevant since total word count is the concern. Likewise, there is a fixed-size output (e.g. yes or no). <br/>

# Deep Learning (DL)
Algorithms dealing with neural network (not limited to NLP). (Provide more...)

<br/>

# Deep Natural Language Processing (DNLP)
Models which are DL models applied to NLP. 
1. CNN for Text Recognition (Classification): CNN is often used for image or video processing/recognition. But it can also be used for text processing. The words are transformed to a matrix (embedding of words). Once this is done the same principles are applied from a Convolutional Neural Network. There is a convolutional layer with multiple filter widths and feature maps. After the pooling layer there is a fully connected layer with dropout and softmax output (elaborate more)...<br/>
2. Seq2Seq (Many Applications): See below
